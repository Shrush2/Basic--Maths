There are ‘N’ doors and ‘N’ people in a house. Each person and door has a unique ID ranging from 1 to ‘N’. A person can change the status of the door i.e, if the door is open then a person can
close the door and vice versa. Initially, all the doors are closed and each person wants to change the status of all doors whose ID is a multiple of the ID of the person. You need to find out
the final status of all the doors.

The answer should be given in a form of a binary string where ‘0’ represents the closed door and ‘1’ represents the open door. For example, the status “close open close” will form a binary string “010”.

T.C => O(N)
S.C => O(N)
