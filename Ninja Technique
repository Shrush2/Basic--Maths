Ninja has its own technique of making a decision to do something or not. This technique is known as the ninja technique. In this technique, Ninja generates a random string containing only digits,
and if any substring whose integer value can be defined as the product of two consecutive integers i.e ‘X = N*(N+1)’ then Ninja do that work else didn’t. So now Ninja wants to invest in the stock market 
so he is using his ninja technique for deciding.
So your task is to write a code that can check whether the string contains any substring whose integer value can be defined as the product of two consecutive integers. 
If any substring exists you should return ‘True’else return‘False’.

Note :

Substring with integer value ‘0’is not considered as special and check only for integers up to length ‘9’as beyond ‘9’integer can’t hold values.
Example :

For the string ‘1242’ we return ‘True’ as for substring:
‘12’ we can be defined as the product of two consecutive integers i.e ‘3’ and ‘4’.
‘2’ we can be defined as the product of two consecutive integers i.e ‘1’ and ‘2’.
‘42’ can be defined as the product of two consecutive integers i.e ‘6’ and ‘7’.
 If the string passes the required condition we have to return ‘True’ else we have to return ‘False’.  

T.C = O(n)
S.C => O(1)
