You are given an integer n. Your task is to compute the GCD (greatest common divisor) of two values:

sumOdd: the sum of the first n odd numbers.

sumEven: the sum of the first n even numbers.

Return the GCD of sumOdd and sumEven.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 4

Output: 4

Explanation:

Sum of the first 4 odd numbers sumOdd = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 16
Sum of the first 4 even numbers sumEven = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 = 20
Hence, GCD(sumOdd, sumEven) = GCD(16, 20) = 4.
